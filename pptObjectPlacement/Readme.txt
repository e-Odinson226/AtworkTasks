# Problem:
At this time robot doesn't calculate coordinates to put down objects, on platform.


# Solution
so the goal is:

1.  Have a FOV of the platform (which objects are going to put on),
    the robot should place objects according to their dimensions and platforms's empty areas.
    
    STATE: developing
        
        
2.  Have an algorithm to arrange objects in such a way,
    to be the optimum state of placing objects according to proportions.(like a puzzle)
    
    STATE: Null
